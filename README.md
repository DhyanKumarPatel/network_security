# Network Security Home Lab

This repository contains my *Network Security Home Lab* assignments, where I explore, configure, and secure an Ubuntu server.  

Each lab is documented as a separate "chapter" in markdown format. The goal of this repo is to:
- Demonstrate hands-on network security skills
- Build a portfolio for cybersecurity job applications
- Show step-by-step exploration of tools and configurations in Ubuntu

## 📚 Chapters
- [Exploring Ubuntu Home Lab](Exploring_Ubuntu_Home_Lab.md)  
  *(Assignment 4: Identifying network interfaces, scanning ports, checking firewall rules, and more)*

- [Exploring Ubuntu Firewall (UFW)](Exploring_Ubuntu_Firewall_UFW.md)  
  *(This assignment emphasized the importance of proper firewall configuration for maintaining system security, preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring that only necessary services are reachable.)*

- [Snort Installation and Configuration Home Lab](Snort_Installation_and_Configuration_Home_Lab.md)  
  *(Assignment 6: Installing and setting up Snort on Ubuntu, configuring network interfaces and defining the HOME_NET variable, adding both community and custom local rules, verifying the configuration, running Snort in IDS or daemon mode, and reviewing alert logs for analysis.)*

- [Network Security SIEM (Suricata + Promtail + Loki + LogCLI)](Network_Security_SIEM_Lab_Report.md)  
  *(Assignment 9: Building and configuring a lightweight SIEM pipeline using Suricata for network event detection, Promtail for log collection, Loki as a central log database, and LogCLI for querying alerts and correlations. Includes custom rule creation, alert validation, correlation analysis, and full system cleanup.)*
